### Question 1
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

- When planning a project, take notes during discussions and share them with the team for clarity.
- Always tell my team about any changes, delays, or issues. Use group chats, video calls, and answer calls promptly.
- When i stuck, explain the problem clearly, mention what i tried, and use visuals like screenshots. This helps me get better answers.

- Keep adding to what I know.
- Improve how I understand and use language.
- Make sure I provide helpful and on-topic responses based on what users say.
